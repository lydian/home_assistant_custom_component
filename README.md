My customized home assistant component

# Kodi
this use the home assistant original one, but I update the source menu,
so that you can directly choose from the video/audio plugin.

# Panasonic
The panasonic tv doesn't allow you to turn it on, so I have a small project that
add infared red transmitor to my rpi and implement the ON function.
